this is to help the program talk to databses...?
a helper is just the class
start with one giant program.cs
then we learn about different folders like models and services that allow us to break up the program
helper is also used to alieviate and smoothen the program.cs file, they will all be linked

piece that is tightly copupled to UI and loosely coupled to surface
magae the lists in 
signal to the service is not dependent on what type of environment i have (console, page, whatever)

these helpers will take signals from button clicks and do the same things but we will replace the console stuff and place it somewhere else

we wantto be able to go through tiny layers of an app and we can rebuild the tiny classes and replace them with maui versions, or whatever other versions. 

it is all about abstraction
